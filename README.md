# react-calculator

I have been in messing around with angularJs for a while, though of giving React "5 minutes"
This is a simple basic calculator mobile app(android or Ios) build with ReactNative

Take away points:
ReactNative was so easy to setup than NativeScript. 
Learn once, write everywhere! ;)
