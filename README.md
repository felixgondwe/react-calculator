# react-calculator

I have been in messing around with angularJs for a while, thought of giving React "5 minutes".

This is a simple basic calculator mobile app(android or Ios) built with ReactNative

Take away points:
ReactNative was so easy to setup than NativeScript. 
Learn once, write everywhere! ;)

--
Detailed documentation is in progress, hang in there. 

--
App is ready to be deployed in Google play market.
